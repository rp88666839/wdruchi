                                                                                               Website Designing Assignment

     1. Introduction to Website Design and HTML Basics
     Theory Assignments :-

            1. Explain the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS.
           Answer :-  1. Inline CSS
                               Definition:   CSS is applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.
                               Syntax:   <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is an inline styled paragraph.</p>
                                Advantages:   Simple to use for small changes.
                                                           Does not require an external file.
                                Disadvantages:   Difficult to maintain for larger projects.
                                                                 Reduces code readability.
                                                                 Styles cannot be reused across multiple elements.
                                2. Internal CSS
                                Definition: CSS is written within a <style> tag inside the <head> section of the HTML document.
                                Syntax:   <head>
                                                 <style>
                                                 p {
                                                 color: green;
                                                 font-size: 18px;
                                                 }
                                                 </style>
                                                 </head>
                                                 <body>
                                                 <p>This is an internally styled paragraph.</p>
                                                 </body>
                                Advantages:
                                                 Centralized styles for the current page.
                                                 Does not require external file loading.
                                Disadvantages:
                                                 Styles are not reusable across multiple pages.
                                                 Can clutter the HTML file.

                                3. External  CSS
                                 Definition: Styles are written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.
                                 Syntax:   <html>
                                                  <head>
                                                  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
                                                  </head>
                                                  <body>
                                                  <p>This is an external CSS example.</p>
                                                  </body>
                                                  </html>
                                 Advantages:
                                                    Best for maintaining consistency across multiple web pages.
                                                    Keeps HTML files clean and organized.
                                                    Improves page loading speed due to CSS caching.                           
                                 Disadvantages:
                                                               Requires an additional request to load the CSS file.
                                                               Styles may not load properly if the CSS file is missing or not linked correctly.


               2. Describe CSS selectors and list the types of selectors (e.g., element, class, id)
               Answer :-  Types of CSS Selectors :-
                                   1. Element (Type) Selector :- Selects all elements of a given type (tag name).
                                       Example :- 
                                                  p {
                                                       color: blue;
                                                       }
                                   2. Class Selector (.) :- Selects all elements with a specific class.
                                        Example :- 
                                                    .highlight {
                                                    background-color: yellow;
                                                   }
                                   3. ID Selector (#) :- Selects a single element with a specific ID (must be unique per page).
                                       Example :- 
                                                   #header {
                                                     font-size: 24px;
                                                   }
                          

              3. Discuss the CSS box model and its components
                   Answer :- HTML element is treated as a rectangular box composed of four layers :-
                                   1.Content :- The actual content inside the box, such as text or an image.
                                                           Size is determined by properties like width and height.
                                   2.Padding :- The space between the content and the border.
                                                           Controls the internal spacing without affecting other elements.
                                       Example :- 
                                                   div {
                                                           padding: 10px;
                                                          }
                                   3.Border :- The boundary surrounding the padding and content.
                                                         Can have different styles (solid, dashed, double, etc.).
                                       Example :- 
                                                   div {
                                                   border: 2px solid black;
                                                   }
                                    4.Margin :- The space outside the border, separating the element from others.
                                                           Does not affect the element's size but affects positioning.
                                        Example:-  
                                                   div {
                                                   margin: 15px;
                                                   }
