    <h1>Home Pages</h1>
    <p>A website homepage is the main entry point and first page visitors see when they land on your site. It serves several key purposes:

    1. First Impression :- The homepage is often the first interaction users have with your brand or organization. It should quickly communicate who you are, 
    what you offer, and why visitors should care.
    2. Navigation Hub :- It provides an overview and guides users to other sections of the website (e.g., About, Products, Services, Contact, Blog). \
    This is typically done through a navigation menu or clear call-to-action (CTA) buttons.</p>
