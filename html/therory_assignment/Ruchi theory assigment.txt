    2. List and explain at least five common HTML tags used in website design.
    Answer :-
             1. <html> – This is the root element of an HTML document. It wraps all the content on a webpage and tells the browser that the document is an HTML file.

             2. <head> – This section contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character encoding, linked stylesheets, and scripts. It does not display any visible content on the webpage.

             3. <body> – This tag contains all the visible content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements that users see and interact with.

             4. <h1> to <h6> – These heading tags define different levels of headings, with <h1> being the largest and most important, and <h6> being the smallest. Headings help structure content and improve accessibility and SEO.

             5. <p> – This tag defines a paragraph of text. It helps to organize content into readable sections and applies default spacing between paragraphs.
